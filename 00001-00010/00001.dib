## Challenge #1

#!markdown

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

#!fsharp

let isMultiple mul n = 
    n % mul = 0

let oneTo1000 = { 0 .. 999 }

let threes = Seq.filter (isMultiple 3) oneTo1000
let fives = Seq.filter (isMultiple 5) oneTo1000

let all = Seq.append threes fives

all |> Seq.distinct |> Seq.sum
